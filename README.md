# Face Mask Detection
Machine Learning Project for determining whether a person is wearing mask or not.
Access the modified dataset. Link - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PXvUqWKJzNlBUaiQ3o3NX-9FUI03eO94/view.

The complete data set can be download from the link - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EG_A3kRwaPn15AFUGmEaQXatKZNXrWxH/view.

The link to the css file for label of classes can be downloaded from the link - https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Fm_bF4TfDMBmxiv_9CqaW7rbnW6AEoP/view.

The algorithm can be extended for complete dataset by putting all the images in a single folder and renaming them appropriately.

Notebook file (B19CSE061_B19EE061.ipynb) file to be used to access the code for the project.

The data download from the above mentioned link should be unzipped. File should be uploaded to drive if wished to be accesses via google drive as in the notebook file.

Path to the folder in which the data files are uploaded should be appropriately edited in cell 4 in the variable named 'path'. For example, if the files are in 'Data_Images' folder in the 'ML Mini Project' folder in the 'MyDrive' folder of the 'gdrive' folder of the contest, the path variable should be set as 
path = '/content/gdrive/MyDrive/ML Mini Project/Data_Images/Data/F'

'F' is added as all images have names starting from F followed by an integer.

After uploading and accessing the folder appropriately, the code must run perfectly.

Note : All cells in the notebook should be run in the provided order only, skipping any cell might lead to errors in the code.
